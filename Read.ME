## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file.
4. Start the application with `npm start`.

## Deployment

this project is deployed using Render. The link is : https://ideausherbackends.onrender.com/

## Documentation

API endpoints are documented in the code itself. 
You can find detailed information about each endpoint and request/response formats in the source code.

## Maintaining the Code

This project follows RESTful API conventions, including proper error handling and middleware for user
authentication. The code is clean and maintainable.

I am sending an API collection which can be imported in Postman and Thunder Client(VS Code Extension)
for testing purposes.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Happy Hacking!
